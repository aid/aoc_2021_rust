# Attempts at Advent of Code 2021 in Rust

This repository is simply a store of my attempts to complete the **[2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)** using the _[rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)_ programming language.

I've been reading and watching videos aout about Rust for q while; but I haven't really written much code.  Completing an Advent of Code in Rust seemed like an ideal way to for me to improve my use of Rust.

I started this project in November 2022 - I'm not very cutting edge!

Cheers
